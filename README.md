## My process 🎓

### Built with 🛠

- Semantic HTML5 Markup - Structure
- CSS3 Custom Properties - Styles
- Mobile-first Workflow
- JavaScript - Programming Logic
- Flexbox - Spaces and Alignments
- Conventional Commits - Commit Specification
- json-server - Backend (Data Base)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
- [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - Modules and Styles
- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - Nomenclature for Classes
- Markdown - README.md file (Documentation)

### What I learned 🧠

With this project, I learned, implemented, and practiced **JavaScript**, along with its properties and methods, such as **fetch**. I also reinforced and practiced my **CSS3** knowledge with **Sass/Scss**, worked on semantic **HTML5** by applying the **BEM** methodology for class naming.

**You can see an example below:**

``` JavaScript



```

### Continued development 🔎

With this path, I want to continue learning more about **JavaScript**, **Responsive Design** and how to work across different devices with **Flexbox** and **Grid**, also I want continue using  **BEM methodology** and perfect the technique in aspects like name the classes, also I want to improve in modularize the component's styles with **Sass** and learn about **Conventional Commits**.
